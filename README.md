# ShizukuX

The advanced privileged-process manager for Android.

An enhanced version of [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) built on top of [thedjchi/Shizuku](https://github.com/thedjchi/Shizuku), with quality-of-life improvements, backported optimizations, and exclusive Plus APIs.

Shizuku lets normal apps use system-level APIs directly via a privileged process started with adb or root. ShizukuX keeps full compatibility while adding features for power users and developers.

## 🐛 Recent Fixes

### Critical Stability Fixes (r2287)
- **Launch crash on some OEM builds** ([#422](https://github.com/thejaustin/ShizukuPlus/issues/422)): a notification icon carrying a theme-attribute tint (`android:tint="?attr/..."`) could fail to resolve in the system's own theme context, crashing the app with `RemoteServiceException: Couldn't create icon StatusBarIcon` (observed on Samsung OneUI 3.1/Android 11). Fixed 4 affected icons and added an automated regression check (`scripts/dev/check-notification-icons.sh` + a JUnit test) so it can't silently reappear.
- **Dev/Beta update channel silently matched Stable** ([#407](https://github.com/thejaustin/ShizukuPlus/issues/407)): the channel picker fetched the newest release by creation date instead of its `prerelease` flag, and CI never actually marked dev/beta builds as GitHub prereleases in the first place — both are now fixed, so the channel setting has real effect again.
- **SU Bridge self-test failure messages were generic** ([#402](https://github.com/thejaustin/ShizukuPlus/issues/402)): now shows the actual deploy failure reason (exit code/stderr) instead of a one-size-fits-all message.

### Critical Server Fixes
- **`attachApplication` binder regression** (commits `8fbe5e47`, `c702a5c`): Fixed a dead-code bug in `Service.onTransact()` where `attachApplication` (binder code 17) was in an unreachable `else` block. This caused ALL API v13+ clients (Morphe, InstallerX, Droid-ify, ObtainX, Obtainium, Termux rish, MT Manager) to fail with `PackageInstaller.asBinder() NullPointerException` or `Not an attached client`.
- **Shell consent persistence** (commit `9f2c01e8`): Shell clients (rish) were always re-prompted even after `Allow always`. Fixed by propagating `callingUid` through the consent intent chain via `Os.getuid()` in `ShizukuShellLoader`.
- **SU bridge dex redeploy** (commit `252d6315`): SU bridge self-test was writing to an already-open file descriptor; fixed by clearing the file before rewriting.
- **Live activity notification respecting toggle** (commit `252d6315`): `ActivityLogSettingsImpl.showNotification()` didn't check the live-activity setting before posting, so disabling the toggle didn't prevent re-notification on the next logged action.

### Manager App / UI Fixes
- **Redesigned App Icon**: Added a "Plus" badge in the upper right of the app icon across the board, natively integrating with the original hexagon geometry.
- **Themed Icon Support**: Implemented a fully vector Material You monochrome icon, enabling the app icon (including the new Plus badge) to respond flawlessly to expressive theme color changes.
- **Theme change black screen eliminated** (commit `14c529a9`): All appearance settings (accent, icon style, blur, OneUI theme, etc.) now update the UI via Compose recomposition instead of `Activity.recreate()`, eliminating 1-2 second black screens.
- **Authentic Samsung OneUI one-handed mode**: One-handed mode now scales content to 75% with bottom-center pivot (matching Samsung's actual behavior) instead of the broken top-padding approach. A follow-up fix corrected an initial corner-anchored pivot that squeezed all content into the bottom-right corner.
- **OneUI Settings header typography** (commit `1c17f3e9`): Settings LargeTopAppBar uses ExtraBold (W800) title at 28sp matching Samsung OneUI 6/7.
- **Bottom navigation bar overlap** (commits `b5ea9e35`, `ff7bb7d6`, `a49baf00`): Fixed Feature Hub, Settings preferences, Activity Log list, and App search bar all being obscured by the floating bottom nav bar.
- **Dhizuku Mode setting persistence** (commit `a8251831`): Toggle state now persists immediately.
- **Update channel respects Dev/Beta** (commit `bbe3ab76`): UpdateChecker now fetches pre-releases when Dev/Beta channel is selected and matches the correct APK asset (Plus vs Drop-In).
- **"Shizuku is running" status icon**: reverted a garbled server-rack/checkmark redesign back to a clean circle-checkmark glyph.
- **Update download hang**: silent auto-install via root/Shizuku had no timeout and could wedge forever on a stuck root prompt, leaving the download stuck with no install prompt. Now times out after 5s and falls back to the system installer.
- **Update progress notification vibration**: progress notification now only alerts once instead of re-buzzing on every progress tick.
- **Empty logs in manual crash reports** ([#405](https://github.com/thejaustin/ShizukuPlus/issues/405), [#397](https://github.com/thejaustin/ShizukuPlus/issues/397), [#317](https://github.com/thejaustin/ShizukuPlus/issues/317)): the logcat tail filter silenced almost everything; now captures the last 300 unfiltered lines.

## ✨ ShizukuX Core Features

*   **Universal Privilege Provider**: Combines **Root**, **ADB Shell**, and **Dhizuku (Device Owner)** into a single unified interface.
*   **OneUI 8+ Theming Fix**: Provides the necessary **Overlay Manager Plus** bridge (using stable **OverlayManagerTransaction** on Android 14+) to allow engines like Hex Installer or Substratum to function on Android 16/17 and OneUI 8+.
*   **Dhizuku Mode (Integrated Device Owner)**: Share the system `DevicePolicyManager` binder with any app that has Shizuku permissions. ShizukuX can now be set as a **Device Owner** via ADB, providing a unified rootless management platform.
*   **Customizable Gestures**: Configure swipe left, swipe right, and long-press actions for any app in the management list.
*   **In-App Changelogs**: Instantly view what's new after an update without leaving the app.
*   **Bulk Management**: Multi-select apps to grant/revoke permissions or hide them in one tap.
*   **Activity Log**: Audit trail of API calls and `su` bridge commands, complete with app icons and real-time dispatch.
*   **Root Compatibility Hub**: Dedicated dashboard to configure and manage legacy root apps with **Granular Module Control** (Magisk Mocking, Auto-Grant, File Interceptor, etc.).
*   **Universal SU Automation**: One-tap 'Magic Setup' to configure all installed root apps to use the ShizukuX SU Bridge.
*   **Service Doctor**: In-app diagnostic tool to troubleshoot and fix service startup issues (now optimized for Samsung Auto Blocker on S22 Ultra).
*   **Integrated Feature Guides**: Every "Plus" feature now includes a dedicated **Information Icon** and detailed technical "About" guide to help users master advanced integrations.
*   **Quick Settings Tile**: Conveniently view and toggle the service status from your notification panel.

## 🚀 Plus API Features

ShizukuX provides exclusive system interfaces for advanced automation and tools:

*   **AICore+ Automation Bridge**: A privileged `AccessibilityService` proxy for AI-driven automation. Supports XML UI hierarchy dumping and physical input simulation (tap/swipe) without requiring root.
*   **AVF (Virtual Machine) Manager**: Manage isolated Linux/Microdroid VMs with VirtIO-GPU acceleration.
*   **Privileged Storage Proxy**: Authenticated access to restricted paths like `/data/data/` or `/data/app/` for backups and file management.
*   **Device Spoofing (Identity Bridge)**: Project hardware identities of modern flagships (Pixel 9 Pro XL, S24 Ultra, etc.) to bypass device-specific restrictions.
*   **Intelligence Bridge (AI Core Plus)**: Privileged NPU scheduling and screen context intelligence.
*   **Window Manager Plus**: Force free-form resizing, manage the system "Bubble Bar," and resilient overlays.
*   **System Theming Bridge (Overlay Manager Plus)**: Expose privileged overlay management for rootless theming (like Hex Installer).
*   **Network & DNS Governor**: Manage Private DNS and iptables routing for rootless ad-blockers and firewalls.
*   **Deep Process Control (Activity Manager Plus)**: Allow advanced process managers to deeply kill apps and set standby buckets.
*   **Continuity Bridge**: Secure state and task handoff between ShizukuX-enabled devices.

## 🛠️ Backporting & Optimizations

ShizukuX makes regular Shizuku apps faster and more compatible without any code changes:

*   **Transparent Shell Interceptor**: Intercepts common `pm`, `am`, and `settings` commands and routes them through high-performance native APIs.
*   **Legacy Compatibility Bridges**:
    *   **Local ADB Proxy**: Emulates an ADB server on port 15555, allowing legacy apps to use Shizuku privileges without keeping the system Wireless ADB enabled.
    *   **SU Bridge (su wrapper)**: A Shizuku-backed `su` binary drop-in replacement for non-rooted apps that support custom root paths.
*   **`plus` CLI Helper**: Adds a privileged command-line utility to the `rish` environment for advanced terminal use.
*   **Dynamic App Database**: Fetches the latest app descriptions and enhancement suggestions from GitHub to keep the UI up-to-date.

## ⚙️ Modular Control

Everything in ShizukuX is optional. Use the **Plus Features** category in Settings to toggle:
*   Transparent Shell Interception
*   Individual Plus APIs (AVF, Storage, Intelligence, etc.)
*   Home screen card visibility
*   Activity Logging

## 🔌 Third-Party App Compatibility

ShizukuX installs under its own package (`af.shizuku.plus.api`) so it can coexist with stock Shizuku. Because most Shizuku-aware apps look specifically for the `moe.shizuku.privileged.api` package, ShizukuX ships a lightweight **Compat Hub** — a tiny companion app that registers that package name and forwards binder/permission requests to ShizukuX.

**If third-party apps don't detect ShizukuX:**
1. Start the ShizukuX service (ADB or root).
2. On the home screen, use the **Compat Hub** card to install the companion (it's bundled in the app; installation goes through the running service, so start the service first).
3. Re-open the third-party app — it should now detect Shizuku and receive the service binder.

Alternatively, install the **drop-in** build, which registers as `moe.shizuku.privileged.api` directly (do not install it alongside stock Shizuku).

## ☑️ Requirements

**Minimum: Android 7+ · Fully supported through Android 17 (SDK 37)**
- **Root mode:** Requires a rooted device
- **Wireless Debugging mode:** Android 11+ and all Android TVs
- **PC mode:** All devices
- **Start on boot:** Available only with Wireless Debugging or Root mode

On **Android 16+**, ShizukuX requests the new Local Network Protection permissions so wireless-debugging discovery and pairing keep working; on **Android 17**, it transparently handles the hidden-API `deviceId` change so authorized apps still appear and permission grants still apply.

## 📱 Developer Guide
